# ANTLR v4 parser for SPECTRE and ELDO languages 

This directory contains code for spectre and eldo parser. For each language, the associated grammar is specified. From these grammars located in the [g4files](g4files/) folder it is possible to generate a native JAVA or C++ parser.

## Project Structure and Files

    .
    ├── g4files/                 # Spectre and Eldo grammar.
    ├── antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar # Antlr v4 library 
    └── README.md

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Requirements

* Java JDK (version 1.6 or higher)

### Generate and compile the parser

Generates and compiles the Java parser.

```
	$ make generate
```

Generates the C++ parser (automatically copies the source files to the source folder).

```
	$ make generate_cpp
```

## How to parse a specific netlist to test the parser
### JAVA parser
To test the parser, you need to have the antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar file in the same directory as the grammar files.

Set the ${CLASSPATH} variable to the path of the antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar file.

```
	$ export CLASSPATH=antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar
```

Then run the following command:

```
	$ java -cp ${CLASSPATH}:parser_java/ org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig SPECTRE netlist <path-to-file>
```

For a ELDO netlist with the JAVA parser:

```
	$ java -cp ${CLASSPATH}:parser_java/ org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig ELDO netlist <path-to-file>
```

Command options:

```
	$ -tokens		// shows all recognized tokens.
	$ -gui			// shows the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of parserized netlist.
	$ -tree			// print in output a text-based representation of the AST generated by the parser.
```

### Cleaning project compiled files

```
	$ make clean
```
